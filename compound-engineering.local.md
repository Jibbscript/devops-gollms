# Review Context

Add project-specific review instructions here.
These notes are passed to all review agents during /workflows:review and /workflows:work.

Examples:
- "We use Turbo Frames heavily — check for frame-busting issues"
- "Our API is public — extra scrutiny on input validation"
- "Performance-critical: we serve 10k req/s on this endpoint"
